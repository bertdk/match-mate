            'Less than half of the patients suffering from sudden cardiac arrest arrive at the hospital alive. Within these survivors less than half will be discharged alive from the hospital without being severely disabled.\n\nThe most frequent cause of death during the first 24 hours since admission to the hospital is related to cardiovascular instability and failure. In the early phases of ROSC patients are hemodynamically unstable and management for out of hospital cardiac arrests relies on few non invasive measurements such as non invasive blood pressure, SatO2, EtCO2 and continuous ECG. Recent technological advances allow continuous non invasive evaluation of response to fluid challenge in mechanically ventilated patients through the pleth variability index.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that early goal directed therapy based on non invasive measurement of the pleth variability index on top of conventional non-invasive monitor during the initial care in the Emergency Department can improve the hemodynamic status of the participants, increase lactate clearance and reduce fluid balance at 48 hours post arrest.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To determine whether an early goal directed management based on the pleth variability index on top of standard non invasive hemodynamic monitoring could improve the hemodynamic status of patients post cardiac arrest especially in terms of increase in lactate clearance and reduced fluid balance. Neurological outcome will be investigated.',

            'Less than half of the patients suffering from sudden cardiac arrest arrive at the hospital alive. Of these survivors less than half will be discharged alive from the hospital without being severely disabled.\n\nThe most frequent cause of death during the first 24 hours since admission to the hospital is related to cardiovascular instability and failure. In the early phases of ROSC from out of hospital cardiac arrest patients are hemodynamically unstable and management relies on few non invasive measurements such as non invasive blood pressure, SatO2, EtCO2 and continuous ECG.\n\nEven at arrival at the ER patients are monitored by non-invasive parameters during the early phases and invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be delayed until ICU admission. Recent technological advances allow continuous non invasive evaluation of response to fluid challenge in mechanically ventilated patients through the pleth variability index.\n\nThe research proposal by the investigator is a randomized prospective interventional, single-center study based at Saint Pierre University Hospital, carried out in the emergency department.\n\nParticipant will be OHCA admitted alive to the Emergency department with unstable hemodynamics defined as a mean systolic pressure below 70 mmHg or a blood lactate concentration of at least 36 mg/dL (4 mmol/L).\n\nThe criteria for exclusion from the study will be pregnancy, being a prisoner or having limitations of therapeutic effort.\n\nDuring the study the investigators will evaluate whether an hemodynamic protocol based on pleth variability index on top of routine non invasive monitoring is superior to the routine non invasive monitoring only ( such as non invasive blood pressure, EtCO2, SatO2 and ECG) in terms of lactate clearance and fluid balance.\n\nIn both study arms the treating clinician will be encouraged to achieve and maintain the following hemodynamics goals: a mean arterial pressure above 70mmHg, a diuresis above 0.5 ml/kg/h, a capillary refill time below 3 and a clearance of lactate above 10% after 2 hours.\n\nIn the control arm the participants will be initially resuscitated with an initial bolus of NaCl 0.9% 10ml/kg whenever the patient is not meeting the set hemodynamic goals. If deemed necessary a second fluid challenge of 100 ml of Albumin 20% will be administered to the patient. Any further fluid challenge will be done with NaCl 0.9% 10ml/kg. At any moment the treating clinician will be allowed to initiate a continuous infusion of noradrenaline or dobutamine to achieve the hemodynamic goals. If deemed necessary clinicians will be allowed to perform a cardiac echography at any moment to assess the hemodynamic needs of the patient. Patients will be continuously reassessed to verify that the hemodynamic goals are achieved.\n\nIn the intervention arm patient will be resuscitated according to their PVI. Whenever the PVI will be above 13% the patient will be considered as being fluid responsive and a fluid challenge will be performed whenever the patient is not meeting the set hemodynamic goals. First fluid challenge will be an initial bolus of NaCl 0.9% 10ml/kg. If deemed necessary a second fluid challenge of 100 ml of Albumin 20% will be administered to the patient. Any further fluid challenge will be done with NaCl 0.9% 10ml/kg. If the hemodynamic goals are not achieved and the PVI is below 13% an infusion of noradrenaline will be initiated aiming at a mean arterial pressure of at least 70 mmHg. Infusion of dobutamine to achieve the hemodynamic goals will be started according to clinician decision. If deemed necessary clinicians will be allowed to perform a cardiac echography at any moment to assess the hemodynamic needs of the patient.\n\nPatients will be continuously reassessed to verify that the hemodynamic goals are achieved.\n\nIn both arms participants will be sedated according to our hospital protocol for OHCA which includes propofol and remifentanyl titrated to achieve a good synchronization between the patient and the ventilator. If despite sedation a good synchronization between the patient and the ventilator cannot be achieved participants will be initially curarized.\n\nIntervention will end at ICU admission when hemodynamic therapeutic decisions will be based on invasive hemodynamic monitoring.\n\nTrainings will be organized for nurses and postgraduate doctors during the months preceding the study to familiarize the medical-nursing team with the study.',
